## Usage

This library is designed to be isomorphic, so that it can be used both on server-side or client-side leveraging the [ethers.js](https://ethers.org) ecosystem.

On client-side it can be used alongside web3 integrations that follow [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers) like [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), which allows connection the user's wallet and using the contracts directly from the browsers.

On server-side it's required to use an [ethers supported provider](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api-keys/), we use and recommend [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

### SoundClient

Most of the library is contained within `SoundClient`, which based on the given `signer` or `provider` certain functions are available.

```ts
import { useAccount } from 'wagmi'

import { SoundClient } from '@soundxyz/sdk'

function Component() {
  const account = useAccount()
  // ...

  const signer = await account.connector?.getSigner()

  // ...

  const client = SoundClient({
    signer,
  })
}
```

```ts
import { StaticJsonRpcProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers'
import { SoundClient } from '@soundxyz/sdk'

const provider = new StaticJsonRpcProvider({
  url: '[__]',
  allowGzip: true,
})

const client = SoundClient({
  provider,
})
```

#### Sound.xyz API

The SDK provides direct connection with [www.sound.xyz](https://www.sound.xyz) API, which needs an `API Key`. It's usage is optional, but certain functions like getting associated audio or images will require it.

To get an `API Key` contact us on our discord server [`discord.gg/soundxyz`](https://discord.gg/soundxyz)

```ts
import { SoundClient } from '@soundxyz/sdk'

// ...

const client = SoundClient({
  // At least one has to be specified
  signer,
  provider,

  apiKey: process.env.SOUNDXYZ_API_KEY,
})
```
